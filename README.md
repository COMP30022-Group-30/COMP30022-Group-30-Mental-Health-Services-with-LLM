# 🧠 Navigating mental health services with LLMs

## 📌 Project Overview

A prototype tool that helps people "talk their way" to relevant mental health services. This project aims to streamline the discovery of services for both consumers (people seeking help) and professionals (e.g., social workers, psychologists) by consolidating fragmented, outdated information into a conversational, location-aware interface.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Enable users to chat with an AI to discover relevant services.
* Query structured/semi-structured service data from a shared database.
* Use user location to filter and rank results.
* Return grounded responses with citations (source, last-checked date, and reasoning).
* (Optional) Enable trusted users to suggest new services via chat, with a moderation process.

## 📌 Notes

* Focus on building the **Core MVP** first: chat → LLM → search → results.
* Avoid feature creep early on.
* Follow up with stretch goals only if time permits.
